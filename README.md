# Welcome to Rendr

Rendr is a small library from [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) that allows you to run your [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) apps seamlessly on both the client and the server. Allow your web server to serve fully-formed HTML pages to any deep link of your app, while preserving the snappy feel of a traditional Backbone.js client-side MVC app.

This repo contains the code examples from my 2013 [Develop Denver](http://www.developdenver.org) Panel. Slides are located [here](http://www.slideshare.net/technicolorenvy/dvlpdnver2013).

# Getting Started

1. clone this repo and cd into it
2. From the command prompt, install the required npm modules

        npm install

3. Start the server

        grunt server
        
Currently this is using the [testscores-api](https://github.com/technicolorenvy/testscores-api) project running on a Heroku instance, but feel free to check this project out and run locally (prob safer that way).

Visit the [Rendr CLI](https://github.com/technicolorenvy/rendr-cli) for more details on using this tool to help you while developing your Rendr app.

Check out the [blog post](http://nerds.airbnb.com/weve-launched-our-first-nodejs-app-to-product) for a more thorough introduction to Rendr.
